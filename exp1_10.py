'''A company insures its drivers in the following cases:
        If the driver is married.
        If the driver is unmarried, male and above 30 years of age.
        If the driver is unmarried, female and above 25 years of age.
        In all the other cases, the driver is not insured.        
    Write a PYTHON program to determine whether the driver     
        is insured or not
